# Login-Light User Authentication

**Expected result**

- Simple login form with name input field only
- User database creation on first login
- Direct localStorage for current user persistence
- Multiple users can login with data isolation
- No password authentication required
- Minimal session handling

**Actual result**

- No authentication system
- No user management
- No current user persistence
- No database per user isolation

**Suggestions**

- Create login page component with name input
- Implement createUserDatabase function with userId pattern
- Use localStorage.setItem('floorsync_currentUser', userId) for persistence
- Add getCurrentUserId() function returning localStorage value
- Create user switching with direct localStorage update
- Add logout with localStorage.removeItem('floorsync_currentUser')
- Test multiple users can login independently
- Verify user data isolation works correctly

### Commentaries:

Additional requirements

[x] Auth storage should store its entire state to the localStorage, not just the name of the user
[x] none redundant info should be stored at the localStorage, such as username while we already store the whole session, which includes username already

[x] React router should have protected routes,
[x] Dashboard should be protected from unauthorized access,
[x] Login should be protected from authorized access, in other words not be accessible when user is already authorized

[x] Authorization state of the user determined by presence of user session in localStorage

---

[x] When user logs in navigated to /dashboard and refreshes the page,

- Actual result: localStorage is clean, no user session there
- Expected result: localStorage to persist user session until logout

---

[x] No `catch` block across the whole app must never hide error details. It should report the error details in console mentioning the particular failed operation

[x] At Login screen username Input box to automatically receive focus for immediate entry of username
